\section{Introduction}

Sensitivity analysis of the long-term post-closure performance of geologic 
repositories in clay media with respect to various key processes and parameters 
utilized the Clay \gls{GDSM} developed by the \gls{UFD} campaign 
\cite{clayton_generic_2011}.  The results here provide an overview of the 
relative importance of processes that affect the repository performance of a 
generic clay disposal concept.

This work is not intended to give an assessment of the performance of a disposal 
system. Rather, it is intended to  generically identify properties and 
parameters expected to influence repository performance in a clay disposal 
envrionment.  Processes and parameters investigated  include the rate of waste 
form degradation, timing of waste package failure, and various coupled 
geochemical and hydrologic characteristics of the natural system including 
diffusion, solubility, and advection.
