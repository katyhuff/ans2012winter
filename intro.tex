\section{Introduction}

Sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to various key processes and 
parameters affecting long-term post-closure performance of geologic repositories 
in clay media. Based on the detailed computational Clay 
\gls{GDSM} developed by the \gls{UFD} campaign \cite{clayton_generic_2011}, 
these results provide an overview of the relative importance of processes 
that affect the repository performance of a generic clay disposal concept model. 
Further analysis supports a basis for development of rapid abstracted models in 
the context of system level fuel cycle simulation. Processes and parameters 
found to influence repository performance include the rate of waste form 
degradation, timing of waste package failure, and various coupled geochemical 
and hydrologic characteristics of the natural system including diffusion, 
solubility, and advection.
