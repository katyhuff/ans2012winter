\section{Introduction}

The development of sustainable nuclear fuel cycles is a key challenge as the use 
of nuclear power expands domestically and internationally. Accordingly, the 
United States and other nations are considering a number of nuclear fuel cycle 
and geologic disposal options simultaneously. These decisions are 
technologically coupled since radionuclide containment in a geologic 
repository is, in part, a function of spent fuel and high level waste 
compositions, which vary among fuel cycle options. Consequently, integrated 
fuel cycle and disposal system analysis grows increasingly necessary for 
informing spent nuclear fuel management policy.  This work enables that analysis 
by identifying dominant physics of radionuclide and heat transport phenomena 
affecting repository performance in homogeneous, reducing geologic media and as 
a function of spent fuel composition. 
%The long term performance characteristics of deep geologic disposal concepts 
%are affected by heat and radionuclide release characteristics sensitive to 
%disposal system choices as well as variable spent fuel compositions associated 
%with alternative fuel cycles. 

Sensitivity analyses using a detailed multiphysics simulation have characterised 
key performance parameters in a candidate repository concept. This concept 
includes a homogeneous, reducing geologic host media and engineered barrier 
components.  This work quantifies the sensitivity of repository performance to 
various site and design parameters in the context of competing and coupled 
physics. Finally, this work informs the extent to which fuel cycle decisions, 
such as separation and transmutation strategies, may 
affect performance.

Parameters of particular interest in fuel cycle systems analysis have 
historically been those related to the front end of the fuel cycle.  
Additionally, previous work in the United States has focused on the oxidizing, 
fractured qranite tuff of Yucca Mountain while international work has focused 
more on reducing and homogeneous geologies. Even internationally, most 
sensitivity analysis has been site-specific \cite{von_lensa_red-impact_2008}. To 
fill this gap, the sensitivity studies in this work addressing a generic disposal 
model in a homogeneous reducing environment are necessary. This work illuminates 
performance distinctions of candidate repository host media, designs, and 
engineering components in the context of varying spent fuel compositions.
