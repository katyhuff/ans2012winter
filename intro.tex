\section{Introduction}

The clay \gls{GDSM}s developed by the \gls{UFD} campaign facilitates sensitivity 
analysis of the long-term post-closure performance of geologic repositories in 
generic media with respect to various key processes and parameters 
\cite{clayton_generic_2011}. Processes and parameters expected to be influential 
to repository performance  include the rate of waste form degradation, timing of 
waste package failure, and various coupled geochemical and hydrologic 
characteristics of the natural system including diffusion, solubility, and 
advection.

The results here provide an overview of the relative importance of processes 
that affect the repository performance of simplified generic disposal 
concepts. This work is not intended to give an assessment of the performance of a 
disposal system. Rather, it is intended to  generically identify properties and 
parameters expected to influence repository performance in a clay disposal 
envrionment.
