\subsection{Case III : Solubility Coefficients}

The dissolution behavior of a solute in an aqueous solution is called its 
solubility. This behavior is restricted by the solute's solubility limit, described  
by an equilibrium constant that depends upon temperature, water chemistry, and 
the properties of the element. 

For modeling simplicity, the solubility limit of each isotope, $i$, was assumed 
to have a solubility limit, $S_i$, equal to the elemental solubility limit of 
the associated element.  By varying the multiplication factor applied to the 
expected solubility limit, $\langle S_i\rangle$, this analysis varied solubility 
limit for each isotope $i$, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:Cases}.  This method 
preserves, in some sense, the relative solubility limits between isotopes, which 
vary over many magnitudes.  

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:SolSum}, for solubility limits below a threshold, 
approximately $1\times10^{-10}[mol\cdot m^{-3}]$, dose releases were directly 
and strongly proportional to the solubility limit. This indicated that the 
radionuclide concentration saturated the groundwater up to the solubility limit 
near the waste form.  For solubility limits above the threshold, however, 
further increase to the limit had no effect on the peak dose. This demonstrated 
the situation in which the solubility limit was so high that even complete 
dissolution of the waste inventory into the pore water was insufficient to reach 
the solubility limit.
