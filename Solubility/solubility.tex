The dissolution behavior of a solute in an aqueous solutions is called its 
\textbf{solubility}. This behavior is limited by the solute's solubility limit, described  
by an equilibrium constant that depends upon temperature, water chemistry, and 
the properties of the element. The solubility constant for ordinary solutes, 
$K_s$ gives units of concentration, $[kg/m^3]$, and can be determined 
algebraically by the law of mass action which gives the partitioning at 
equilibrium between reactants and products.  For a reaction
\begin{align}
  cC + dD &= yY + zZ,
  \intertext{where}
  c,d,y,z  &= \mbox{ amount of respective constituent }[mol]\nonumber\\
  C,D  &= \mbox{ reactants }[-]\nonumber\\
  Y,Z  &= \mbox{ products }[-]\nonumber,
  \intertext{the law of mass action gives}
  K &= \frac{(Y)^y(Z)^z}{(C)^c(D)^d}
  \intertext{where}
  (X)  &= \mbox{ the equilibrium molal concentration of X }[mol/m^3]\nonumber\\
  K  &= \mbox{ the equilibrium constant }[-].\nonumber
  \label{massaction}
\end{align}

The reference solubilities for each element were multiplied by the multiplier 
for each simulation group. This technique preserved relative solubility among 
  elements.
