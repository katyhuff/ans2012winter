  \frametitle{Summary of Sensitivity Analyses}
  In the Clay \gls{GDSM}, 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the threshold between the advective and diffusive regimes was found 
      outside of the expected parametric range for a clay repository,
    \item Solubility and sorption characteristics of dose contributing elements 
      have a strong effect on the importance of dispersion and advection 
      parameters.
    \item waste form degradation rates over $1\times10^{-8} [yr]$ are also 
      ineffective at decreasing the mean of the peak annual dose,
    \item waste package lifetimes under one million years are ineffective at 
      decreasing the mean of the peak annual dose,
  \end{itemize}
