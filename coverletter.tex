    \opening{Dr. Nicholas Tsoulfanidis and Associate Editors,}

I am pleased to submit this manuscript, `Key Processes and Parameters in a 
Generic Clay Disposal System Model' for publication in Nuclear Technology. 

This work is an extended version of a summary of the same name included in the 
Transactions of the ANS Winter Meeting in 2012. The editorial review at the time 
included the suggestion that the summary was a ``Good paper for journal 
publication.'' Since then, I have addressed additional comments in that review 
and extended the article so that it is more appropriate for publication in 
Nuclear Technology.  

This manuscript describes a sensitivity analysis using a detailed simulation 
environment. This sensitivity analysis captured the importance of various 
physical features of siting and engineering decisions in a geologic repository 
concept. The results inform the nature of the coupled relationship between fuel 
cycle and geologic repository decisions.

I believe Nuclear Technology is the most appropriate destination for this work, 
in particular because this journal encourages submission of complete papers of 
work previously summarized in the Transactions of American Nuclear Society.

      \closing{Sincerely,}

       \end{letter}
