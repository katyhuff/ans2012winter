\section{Conclusion}

This repository concept is "safe" for realistic physical values.  Key parameters 
included many of those analyzed, but waste form lifetime was unimportant due to 
the long geologic media pathway Solubility and Sorption had strong effects, 
indicating that the inventory of high solubility, low sorption radionuclides 
could drive waste treatment Unfortunately, highly soluble radionuclides in clay 
typically include $^{129}$I, etc., for which there is very little available 
strategy for transmutation or alternative use.  The advective and diffusive 
regimes have distinctly different behavior for different nuclides.  Repository 
site and engineered barrier selection is a frought topic politically.  
Pinpointing the differentiating physics for complex multiphysics systems of this 
nature can guide R\&D as well as decisionmaking.
