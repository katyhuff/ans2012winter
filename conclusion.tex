\section{Conclusion}


What does it all mean? 

This repository concept is "safe" for realistic physical values.
Key parameters included many of those analyzed, but waste form lifetime was unimportant due to the long geologic media pathway
Solubility and Sorption had strong effects, indicating that the inventory of high solubility, low sorption radionuclides could drive waste treatment

Unfortunately, highly soluble radionuclides in clay typically include 129I, etc., for which there is very little available strategy fro 


What hypotheses were proven?

The advective and diffusive regimes have distinctly different behavior for different nuclides.

What did I learn? 
Why does it make a difference? 

Repository site and engineered barrier selection is a frought topic politically. Pinpointing the differentiating physics for complex multiphysics systems of this nature can guide R&D as well as decisionmaking.
