Sensitivity analyses identifying key processes and parameters in saturated, 
homogeneous, clay repository environments were performed using the Clay 
\gls{GDSM} developed by the \gls{UFD} campaign. The Clay \gls{GDSM} is built on 
the GoldSim software and tracks the movement of key radionuclides through the 
natural system and engineered barriers.  The results here provide an overview of 
the relative importance of processes that affect the repository performance of 
simplified generic disposal concept in saturated, homogeneous clay envrionments.
