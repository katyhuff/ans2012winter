Sensitivity analyses identifying key processes and parameters in saturated, 
homogeneous, clay repository environments were performed using the Clay 
\gls{GDSM} developed by the \gls{UFD} campaign\cite{clayton_generic_2011}. The 
Clay \gls{GDSM} is built on the GoldSim software and tracks the movement of key 
radionuclides through the natural system and engineered barriers 
\cite{golder_goldsim_2010, golder_goldsim_ct_2010}.  The results here provide an 
overview of the relative importance of processes that affect the repository 
performance of simplified generic disposal concepts.  This work is not intended 
to give an assessment of the performance of a disposal system. Rather, it is 
intended to  generically identify properties and parameters expected to 
influence repository performance in saturated, homogeneous clay envrionments.
