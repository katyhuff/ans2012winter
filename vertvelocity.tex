\subsection{Vertical Advective Velocity}

In this analysis, the threshold between primarily diffusive and primarily 
advective transport was investigated by varying the vertical advective velocity 
in conjunciton with the diffusion coefficient. 
For the low diffusion coefficients and low advective 
velocities usually found in clay media, the model demonstrated behavior entirely 
in the diffusive regime. However, as the vertical advective velocity was 
increased, system behavior increasingly approached the advective regime. 

In general, higher advective velocity and higher diffusivity lead to higher 
means of the peak annual dose. However, the relationship between diffusivity and 
advective velocity adds depth to the notion of a boundary between diffusive and 
advective regimes.

Soluble and non-sorbing nuclides $^{129}I$ and 
$^{36}Cl$ are more sensitive to vertical advective velocity for lower vertical 
advective velocities. This demonstrates that for vertical advective velocities 
above a threshold ($6.31\times10^{-6}[m/yr]$),lower reference diffusivities are 
ineffective at attenuating the mean of the peak doses for soluble, non-sorbing 
elements. 

Solubility limited and sorbing elements such as $Tc$ and $Np$ show a very weak 
influence on peak annual dose rate for low reference diffusivities, but show a 
direct proportionality between dose and reference diffusivity above a threshold. 
For $^{99}Tc$, for example, that threshold occurs at $1\times10^{-11}[m^2/s]$.  
Dose contribution from these elements show a proportional 
relationship with vertical advective velocity above a regime threshold at 
$6.31\times10^{-5}[m/yr]$, above which the system exhibits sensitivity to 
advection. 

The convergence of the effect of the reference diffusivity and vertical 
advective velocity for sorbing elements shows the effect of sorption. $Se$ is 
non sorbing, but solubility limited.  Results from $^{79}Se$ show that for low 
vertical advective velocity, the system is diffusion dominated.  However, for 
high vertical advective velocity, the diffusivity remains important even in the 
advective regime as spreading facilitates transport in the presence of 
solubility limited transport. This indicates that for high vertical advective 
velocity, the sorption properties of an element significantly impact 
behavior.
