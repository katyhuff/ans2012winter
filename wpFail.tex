\subsection{Case VI : Waste Package Failure Time and Diffusion Coefficient}

To investigate the effect of the waste package failure time, it was varied over 
five magnitudes from one thousand to one million years. Simultaneously, the reference 
diffusivity was varied over the eight magnitudes between $1\times10^{-8}$ and 
$1\times10^{-15}$ in order to determine the correlation between increased 
radionuclide mobility and the waste package lifetime. 


For the clay repository, the waste package failure time was shown to be entirely 
irrelevant until waste package failure times reach the million year time scale, 
at which point it has an effect primarily on the dose due to long lived 
isotopes.
